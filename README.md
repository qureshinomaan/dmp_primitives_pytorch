# dmp_primitives_pytorch
Tools for using motion primitives like Dynamic Motion Primitives or Differentiable Linear Dynamic Systems in PyTorch.

## TODOs
- [x] Code the DMP part in a interpretable way. 
- [x] Batched CEM optimization for DMPs
- [ ] Code differentiable Linear Dynamic Systems (dLDS).
- [ ] Code Cubic Splines
- [ ] CEM optimization for dLDS and cubic splines.
- [ ] Neural output code for training dLDS, splines and DMPs. 
- [ ] A very simple colab tutorial for introducing these primitives.
