# dmp_primitives_pytorch
Tools for using motion primitives like Dynamic Motion Primitives or Differentiable Linear Dynamic Systems in PyTorch.

## TODOs
[x] Code the DMP part in a interpretable way. 
[x] Batched CEM optimization for DMPs
[] Code differentiable Linear Dynamic Systems (dLDS).
[] CEM optimization for dLDS.
[] Neural output code for training dLDS and DMPs.
